# NOS Gen-AI Hackathon

Welcome to the official repository for the NOS Gen-AI Hackathon, part of the SCAILE initiative! In this repository, you will find essential resources including the official hackathon rules, code snippets, and examples designed to facilitate your development process. Additionally, we provide a baseline structure to guide you in addressing the proposed challenge effectively.

## 0. Problem Statement and Evaluation Criteria

For a complete description of the problem statement and the detailed evaluation criteria, refer to this [document](tutorials/problem_and_eval.md).

## 1. Prerequisites
Before participating in the hackathon, please ensure that you meet the following prerequisites. Having the needed accounts and accesses will help streamline your development process and facilitate the use of necessary tools and APIs.

### 1.1. GitHub Account
